							<p>A little about me: I got my PhD in the Space and Atmospheric Physics Department at Imperial College London, UK, before moving to the University of Washington in Seattle, USA as a <a href = "https://cicoes.uw.edu/education/postdoc-program/">JISAO Post-doctoral Fellow</a> with <a href = "https://www.atmos.washington.edu/~david/">Prof. David Battisti</a>. Torn between a new-found love for the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, and missing Europe, in 2018 I moved to Barcelona, Spain as a <a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships">Marie-Curie Post-doctoral Fellow</a>, but then, in 2020, I moved back across the "pond" yet again to Vancouver, Canada (quick tip: international moves in the middle of a global pandemic? Not recommended!).

							<p> I enjoy playing with general circulation models (GCMs, or 'climate models'), mostly the Community Earth System model (<a href="https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/">CESM</a>), but also the <a href="https://execlim.github.io/IscaWebsite/">ISCA</a> framework for idealised general circulation modelling and the regional Weather Research and Forecasting Model (<a href ="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model">WRF</a>). Some of my favourite experiments include moving mountains around in climate models (see <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL084780">this paper</a>), removing some mountains altogether (see <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0401.1">our paper on the importance of the Mongolian mountains</a>) or even rotating the Earth backwards in a climate model to better understand why our climate today looks the way it does (see results in <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/78/7/JAS-D-20-0300.1.xml">this paper</a>). When I'm not playing with mountains in climate models, I enjoy playing in real mountains - hiking, backpacking, even horse-back riding in Mongolia (and pretending to removing the Mongolian mountains whilst there!). As of 2022 I have completed about 75% of the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_11_(Spain)">GR11</a>, a ~840km traverse of the Spanish Pyrenees - the picture at the top of this page is from that hike, in the Aig&#252estortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park. <br><br><br></p>

							<p> Working in climate science, I'm all too aware of the future that awaits us if we don't take substantial and meaningful steps to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. When I was living in Barcelona, I gave up air travel to help reduce my carbon footprint, and had some fantastic journeys by train across Europe when I travelled for work - it was a great excuse to visit colleagues in different cities along the way. Giving up air travel is easier to do on a continent with excellent train connections, and when you don't live an ocean away from your family, but even in North America there are things I do to reduce my carbon footprint: I have an e-bike I use to get around Vancouver and commute to work on (and take the bus in winter when I get tired of being rained on every day), I've substantially reduced meat from my diet (particularly red meat which has the biggest climate impact) and I have been involved in many climate outreach events to help get conversations going about climate change, its impacts and what we can do - see <a href= "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/stories/climate-action/">this website</a> for more ideas for how you can reduce your carbon footprint. I also enjoy learning, practicing and performing aerial circus and flying trapeze, and I have plans to combine aerial circus and climate outreach... watch this space!
