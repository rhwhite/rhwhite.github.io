								<h4>Rachel H. White</h4>
								<p>Assistant Professor, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences</p>
							</header>
							<p>Rachel leads the UBC Climate Dynamics group here at UBC. Her research interests are based in large-scale atmospheric dynamics, and currently she is most interested in understanding the connections between atmospheric circulation and extreme weather events and how we can use these connections to provide better predictions of extreme weather events and to better understand how anthropogenic climate change will affect weather extremes. She runs and analyzes results from climate models, and analyzes data from atmospheric observations to explore a wide variety of questions about our climate, from: How accurately can we predict the probability of summer heat waves weeks to months in advance? to: What differences would we see in atmospheric circulation patterns if the Earth rotated backwards? For more information, including her plans to combine climate outreach with aerial circus, click <a href="rachel.html">here</a>. <br><br>

					<h3>Prospective undergraduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Undergraduates are an important part of the McKinnon group. In most cases, undergraduate researchers work in a group of 2-3 on a self-contained project advised by myself and a senior PhD student or post-doc. In general, undergraduates who want to join the group should have experience coding (python preferred), an ability to commit to research for at least one academic year, and a desire to learn how to perform independent research. If this sounds like you, and you are excited to work on problems in climate science and/or related statistical methods, please email me with a short statement explaining your interests and background, as well as your CV. If I do not have open positions at the time of your email, I will get in touch when a position becomes available.</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Applications for the 2022-2023 academic year have closed. In general, I can admit students through the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>, and the <a href="https://aos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>. Your experience doing research in my group will be the same regardless of which program you apply to; however, the course requirements and funding structures are different. Please explore the websites of the different programs to figure out what seems to meet your needs best, and get in touch with the academic administrators if you have further questions about the logistics and requirements of each program.<br>
					<br>
					If you decide to apply to one of the above programs to work with me, feel free to reach out by email to give me a heads up that you've applied. Note that I find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to chat with prospective students once applications have been submitted. If the application fee is an undue burden, please do get in touch with the relevant department about a waiver. This will not affect how your application is assessed.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective post-docs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					I will be formally advertising for post-doc positions in the near future. Have a cool idea that you want to work on, related to the research in the group? Please drop me an email saying hi, and telling me about it.<br>
					<br>
					In addition, be in touch if you are interested in applying to a post-doctoral fellowship to work together. Some potential funding sources for post-docs are the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Global Change post-doc</a>, the various <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF post-docs</a>, the <a href="https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/">McDonnell Foundation post-doc</a>, and the <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/overview/">Schmidt Science Fellows</a>. In addition, the University of California system supports the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/working-at-ucla/postdocs/presidents-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/">President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program</a> for female and minority PhD recipients.
