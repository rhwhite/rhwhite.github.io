								<h4>Rachel H. White</h4>
								<p>Assistant Professor, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences</p>
							</header>
							<p>Rachel leads the UBC Climate Dynamics group here at UBC. Her research interests are based in large-scale atmospheric dynamics, and currently she is most interested in understanding the connections between atmospheric circulation and extreme weather events and how we can use these connections to provide better predictions of extreme weather events and to better understand how anthropogenic climate change will affect weather extremes. She runs and analyzes results from climate models, and analyzes data from atmospheric observations to explore a wide variety of questions about our climate, from: How accurately can we predict the probability of summer heat waves weeks to months in advance? to: What differences would we see in atmospheric circulation patterns if the Earth rotated backwards?

								<h4>Cuiyi Fei</h4>
								<p>PhD student</p>
							</header>
							<p>Cuiyi is a fifth-year PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science at UBC with Prof. Rachel White. Her research focuses on midlatitude atmospheric dynamics, particularly quasi-stationary Rossby waves. She has analyzed large ensemble climate model output and conducted a series of idealized experiments to investigate the mechanisms of quasi-stationary waves, assess model performance, and diagnose underlying biases. In addition, she is working on an interdisciplinary project with Prof. Ethan Raker, exploring the relationship between heatwaves and demographics. Cuiyi earned her BSc in Atmospheric Science from Sun Yat-Sen University in China in 2020. During that time, she explored various research directions before ultimately focusing on atmospheric dynamics. Read more about Cuiyi and her research <a href="cuiyi.html">here</a>.<br><br>

                                                       <p>Lynn is a second-year PhD student in Atmospheric Science at UBC. She is co-supervised by Dr. Roland Stull and Dr. Rachel White and you can find her on campus at the Weather Forecast Research Team laboratory. Lynn's research <i>Improving Winter Forecast Temperatures in the Peace Region of Alberta and British Columbia</i>, funded by BC Hydro and MITACS, is crucial for enhancing extreme winter temperature forecasts in the region. Improving winter temperature forecasting is vital to BC Hydro for several reasons: first, to ensure the safety of residents in the town of Peace River, Alberta, where ice jamming and flooding hazards occur on the Peace River; and second, to optimize hydroelectric power generation by better managing water resources. However, accurate forecasts in this region are challenging due to Arctic air masses, downslope windstorms, and complex terrain. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, her work enhances mesoscale weather prediction, with a focus on cold-air damming and Chinook events.</p>
							<p>To address the scarcity of weather observations, particularly in the vertical domain, Lynn initiated and led a winter fieldwork campaign, launching radiosonde balloons multiple times daily in varying air masses, and ice conditions along the Peace River.</p>
							<p>Lynn has been a registered geoscience professional for over 20 years and previously worked as a geophysicist in the Canadian Oil and Gas industry.  Her technical background includes seismic interpretation of complex geology worldwide, utilizing advanced techniques such as seismic inversion, machine learning, and 3D visualization for subsurface analysis.  She also has experience in risk analysis, investment, and asset management.</p>
							<p>Lynn holds a B.Sc. in Applied Physics/Geophysics from the University of Waterloo.  She transitioned to graduate studies and completed her M.Sc. in Geosciences with a specialization in Applied Meteorology from Mississippi State University in August 2023.</p>

                                                       <p>Sayana is a fifth-year undergraduate student pursuing a combined degree in Physics and Oceanography at UBC. She is passionate about the intersections of Earth and ocean sciences, natural resource conservation, climate activism, and social justice. Her keen interest in climate science deepened in 2023 after taking a climate change course with Dr. Rachel White, which led her to join the Climate Dynamics Group as an undergraduate research assistant. Her current project involves analyzing geopotential height anomalies in multiple climate models and reanalysis datasets to assess how accurately these models capture atmospheric variability. In her free time, when she is not doing cool climate modelling work, she loves backpacking, playing music with her band and dancing! Occasionally, you can find her starting another new (and unsuccessful) crocheting or baking project. Sayana is open for collaboration and learning; please feel free to reach out to her at the email below. <br><br>

					<h3>Prospective undergraduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Undergraduates are an important part of the McKinnon group. In most cases, undergraduate researchers work in a group of 2-3 on a self-contained project advised by myself and a senior PhD student or post-doc. In general, undergraduates who want to join the group should have experience coding (python preferred), an ability to commit to research for at least one academic year, and a desire to learn how to perform independent research. If this sounds like you, and you are excited to work on problems in climate science and/or related statistical methods, please email me with a short statement explaining your interests and background, as well as your CV. If I do not have open positions at the time of your email, I will get in touch when a position becomes available.</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Applications for the 2022-2023 academic year have closed. In general, I can admit students through the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>, and the <a href="https://aos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>. Your experience doing research in my group will be the same regardless of which program you apply to; however, the course requirements and funding structures are different. Please explore the websites of the different programs to figure out what seems to meet your needs best, and get in touch with the academic administrators if you have further questions about the logistics and requirements of each program.<br>
					<br>
					If you decide to apply to one of the above programs to work with me, feel free to reach out by email to give me a heads up that you've applied. Note that I find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to chat with prospective students once applications have been submitted. If the application fee is an undue burden, please do get in touch with the relevant department about a waiver. This will not affect how your application is assessed.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective post-docs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					I will be formally advertising for post-doc positions in the near future. Have a cool idea that you want to work on, related to the research in the group? Please drop me an email saying hi, and telling me about it.<br>
					<br>
					In addition, be in touch if you are interested in applying to a post-doctoral fellowship to work together. Some potential funding sources for post-docs are the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Global Change post-doc</a>, the various <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF post-docs</a>, the <a href="https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/">McDonnell Foundation post-doc</a>, and the <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/overview/">Schmidt Science Fellows</a>. In addition, the University of California system supports the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/working-at-ucla/postdocs/presidents-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/">President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program</a> for female and minority PhD recipients.
